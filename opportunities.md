### Postdoctoral Fellowship or PhD student

The Fertig lab seeks a highly motivated postdoctoral fellow or PhD student for genomics and precision medicine. 

The successful applicant develop single cell technologies and/or analysis methods in collaboration with leading computational and clinical investigators in the Johns Hopkins University Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center and Bloomberg~Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy. 

The ideal candidate will have previous experience in cancer systems biology research using high throughput genomics data. Preference will be given to candidates with experience in either computational methods or wet bench technology development for single cell profiling.

**Application Procedure:**

Interested applicants should submit a cover letter describing the reason for their interest and fit to the position requirements, their CV, and names and contact information of three references to Dr. Fertig (<a href="mailto:ejfertig@jhmi.edu">ejfertig@jhmi.edu</a>).

**Requirements:**

- PhD in cancer biology, computational biology, biostatistics, biomedical engineering, applied mathematics, or a related field. 
- Problem-solving skills and independence.
- The ability to work as part of a multidisciplinary team.
- Excellent written and verbal communication skills.

**Requirements for a computational trainee:**

- Proficiency in programming with R/Bioconductor and/or python for genomics analysis. 
- Experience with high-performance computing clusters and LINUX scripting.
- Techniques for reproducible research and version control, including but not limited to experience generating knitr reports, GitHub repositories, and R package development.
- Additional experience in analysis of single cell data, unsupervised learning, or programming in C++ preferred but not required.

**Requirements for a wet-lab trainee:**

- Proficiency in high-throughput genomics data generation.  
- Experience with protocol development and implementation for single cell technologies. 
- Previous research experience in precision medicine for cancer or cancer immunotherapy preferred, but not required.

### Faculty Level Non-Tenure Track Data Scientist / Bioinformatician

The Fertig lab at the Johns Hopkins University, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center seeks a faculty level, non-tenure track bioinformatician / data scientist. The candidate will work in a highly collaborative, inter-disciplinary environment on translational computational cancer biology. The successful applicant will be responsible for pipeline management, software development, and training of single-cell multi-omics analysis methods. 

The ideal candidate will have previous experience in R/Bioconductor, biopython, or similar with recommended experience in C++. Although not required, preference will be given to candidates with experience in single-cell analysis.

**Application Procedure:**
